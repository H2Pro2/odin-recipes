    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../img/pizza.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This is another one from Italy. It's easy to make but hard to master. </p> 
    <p>I'm going to assume everyone knows and loves the pizza. So I am just going to </p>
    <p>push you in the right direction of finding out what you like most about your specific</p>
    <p>type of your pizza.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>300g of type 00 flour</li>
        <li>~250ml of water</li>
        <li>3g of dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Preparation</h5>
    
    <p>Mix the flour with the salt and yeast in a bowl. Now add most of the water and mix it.</p>
    <p>If there is still a lot of flour in the bowl add little by little from your 250ml bottle of water.</p>
    <p>At some point your dough is hydrated enough to form a homogenous dough ball.</p>
    <p>If it feels dry, moisten your hands. If it feels wet add a bit of water.</p>
    <p>Now you just got to kneed it for around 10 minutes.At this point you can take out your</p>
    <p>dough ball and add a little olive oil to the bowl. Put the dough ball back in and cover</p>
    <p>the bowl with something so your dough doesn't dry out.</p>
    <p>Now you have to wait for atleat 2 hours.</p>

    <h4>Marinara</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 can of peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 - 3 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Preperation</h5>
    <p>Crush the peeled tomatoes in a bowl and add the salt. That's pretty much it.</p>

    <h4>Baking the Pizza in a homeoven</h4>
    <p>Since I'm sadly not one of the people with an ooni koda, I had to somehow find a way to</p>
    <p>make a pizza in a homeoven. But first we have to form our dough ball.</p>
    <p>Place the ball on a lightly floured workplace, then push it down with the palm of your hand.</p>
    <p>Try to flatten it as much as possible while leaving something that resembles the outer crust.</p>
    <p>Now hold up the outer crust with both of your hands like it is a steering wheel and </p>
    <p>turn it while the dough doesn't touch the workplace.</p>
    <p>Move your hands along the crust till gravity did it's job and you have your desired thickness.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now place it on a baking sheet which is ontop of a baking iron.</p>
    <p>Spread the marinara on the pizza and you're nearly done!</p>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 250Â°C and wait till it's burning hot.</p>
    <p>Now place the pizza on the lowest place in your oven for 9 minutes.</p>
    <p>After that open the oven, and place some cut pieces of fresh mozzarella over it.</p>
    <p>Right after that place the pizza on the topmost place in the oven and wait till the crust</p>
    <p>starts to get to dark for your liking.</p>
    <p>To finish it all off add a bit of fresh basel and some olive oil.</p>
    <p>You're now left with a pretty decent homeoven version of a neapolitan pizza!</p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
